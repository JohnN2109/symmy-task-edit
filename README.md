docker compose exec web python manage.py shell
```

Then run:

```python
from integrator.tasks import sync_products
sync_products.delay()
```

## Run tests

```bash
docker compose exec web python manage.py test
```

## Validation rules

- negative price -> invalid
- missing price -> invalid
- duplicate SKU -> invalid
- invalid stock value -> invalid

## Notes

The E-shop API is mocked intentionally because the provided API endpoint does not exist.
Synchronization requests are simulated via logging.# symmy-task-edit
